Some papers assign the copyright to a commercial publisher such as Springer
or ACM.  We cannot publish proceedings that contain papers that are 
copyrighted by another publisher.

If this was a mistake by the authors of the respective papers, you may want
to request new PDFs from them that do not contain such a copyright 
footnote, or contain a copyright footnote that is compatible with the 
CEUR-WS.org copyright clause.

If you can get new PDFs, then please upload a revised ZIP file.
